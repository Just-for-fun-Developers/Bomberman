# Bomberman-like Online Multiplayer Game Roadmap

## 1. Requirements Definition

- **Game Rules**:
  - Define game mechanics such as the number of players, map design, power-ups, etc.
- **Platform Features**:
  - User registration, ranking system, chat, etc.

## 2. Technology and Tool Selection

- **Backend**:
  - Since you favor Python, consider frameworks like Django or Flask for the backend and session handling.
- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL or SQLite are recommended.
- **Real-time Communication**:
  - Use WebSockets. A popular Python tool for this is `channels` with Django.
- **Frontend**:
  - For game creation, Phaser.js or Three.js are commonly used JavaScript libraries. If you lean towards Python, Brython is a Python 3 implementation for the web, but you might still need some JS libraries for desired game behavior.

## 3. Design and Prototype

- **Graphics**:
  - Design the game's sprites, maps, and elements.
- **Prototype**:
  - Create a single-machine game prototype without the multiplayer part to ensure basic mechanics work.

## 4. Backend Development

- **Database Configuration**:
  - Set up for users, scores, games played, etc.
- **User Authentication**:
  - Implement sign-up and login features.
- **Game Logic**:
  - Character movement, bomb placement, collision detection, etc.
- **Real-time Sync**:
  - Implement real-time communication to synchronize game state among players.

## 5. Frontend Development

- **Game Rendering**:
  - Use the chosen library (e.g., Phaser.js) to implement game rendering.
- **Backend Connection**:
  - Connect the frontend to the backend using WebSockets.
- **Additional Features**:
  - Add features like chat, leaderboards, profile settings, etc.

## 6. Testing

- **Beta Testing**:
  - Test the game with friends or colleagues to identify and rectify bugs.
- **Load Testing**:
  - Ensure your server can handle multiple games and players simultaneously.

## 7. Launch and Scaling

- **Deployment**:
  - Host your game on a cloud server (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku).
- **Monitoring**:
  - Monitor usage and consider scaling your setup if there's an uptick in player numbers.

## 8. Maintenance and Enhancements

- **Feedback Loop**:
  - Listen to player feedback and consider implementing requested features or fixing reported issues.
- **Updates**:
  - Release game updates and enhance the game over time.
